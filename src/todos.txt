TreBusNative TODOs:


* Drag'n'drop re-ordering of hotspots

* Handling situations where the user is not in Tampere

* HotspotView with multiple next routes
    * Line changes!


* Real-time data for busses
    * Maybe a map per stop
        * Display the chosen stop and all the busses that go through it
            * Maybe tooltips for each bus about the estimated real time arrivals
    * Maybe a schedule thing like mobile Lissu








DONEs:
* trim form field inputs
* Limit searches to Tampere only (currently searching for "Rautatieasema" in some other city)
* Hotspot validation: names must be unique (currently not required, which messes up deleting)
