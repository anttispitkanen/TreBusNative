TreBusNative TODOs:

* Edit Hotspot

* Drag'n'drop re-ordering of hotspots???

* HotspotView with multiple next routes
    * Line changes!


* Real-time data for busses
    * Maybe a map per stop
        * Display the chosen stop and all the busses that go through it
            * Maybe tooltips for each bus about the estimated real time arrivals
    * Maybe a schedule thing like mobile Lissu


* Login with username (=API key) and password (=API pass)
    => enables making source public


* Pictures in background for Hotspot and AddHotspotForm

* Adding custom pictures for each Hotspot (background image and thumbnail)
    * Filepicker
    * Camera usage


* Manual input of Location

* Error in resizing form background image when keyboard is open

DONEs:
* trim form field inputs
* Limit searches to Tampere only (currently searching for "Rautatieasema" in some other city)
* Hotspot validation: names must be unique (currently not required, which messes up deleting)
* Preven adding hotspot with invalid address
* Add header background image
* Spinner for routing swipe => spins while fetching route, releases when ready?
* Lock app to portrait orientation on iOS (xcode)
* Icons for app
* Arrow click ordering of hotspots
* Some mechanism to avoid unnecessary routing every time the hotspots are rearranged
* Handling situations where the user is not in Tampere
    * Check if the response.city matches 'Tampere'
